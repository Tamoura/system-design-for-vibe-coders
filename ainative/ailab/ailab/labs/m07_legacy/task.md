# REMIT-372: make the ledger safe to change, then move Remit to najmkit 2

**From:** Tariq, Engineering Lead, Payments Platform (Hessa's business reason is at the end)
**To:** You, and your AI coding tool if you use one
**Priority:** Normal. Money logic: a second human reviews it before it merges.

`src/remit/ledger.py` is Remit's oldest code and has no tests. Its books live in module-level
variables, so a process can have exactly one set of books. Finance's reconciliation job needs two
`RemitService` objects in one process, each with its own ledger. And najmkit 3 will remove najmkit 1.

Three parts, in this order, in separate commits. **Behaviour must not change anywhere**, quirks
included, except where this ticket says so. Read the docstring of `ledger.py` first.

### Part 1: pin what the ledger does now

1. Copy `lab-assets/ledger_port.py` to `tests/ledger_port.py`: a seam with `make_ledger()` (a fresh
   ledger) and `ledger_of(service)` (the ledger a service posts to), working before and after Part 2.
2. Write characterization tests in **new files named `tests/test_ledger_*.py`**. They say what the code
   does today, quirks included, not what you think it should do. Reach the ledger only through
   `make_ledger()` and `ledger_of(service)`.
3. They must pass on the code as it is now and, unchanged, after Part 2. The grader runs them against
   the original ledger and against deliberately broken copies of it. Do not rely on edits to
   `tests/conftest.py`.

### Part 2: remove the module-level state

After the refactor the interface is exactly this:

    # src/remit/ledger.py
    class Ledger:
        def __init__(self) -> None: ...                       # no arguments needed
        def post_transfer(self, transfer_id: str, customer_id: str, send_amount: Money, fee: Money) -> list[dict]: ...
        def balance(self, account: str) -> Decimal: ...
        def accounts(self) -> list[str]: ...
        def journal(self) -> list[dict]: ...

    # src/remit/service.py
    class RemitService:
        def __init__(self, store, rates, watchlist, clock, notifier, ledger: Ledger | None = None) -> None: ...
        # self.ledger is the Ledger in use; ledger=None means a fresh Ledger() for this service

- State belongs to the instance: no changing module-level variables, no mutable class attributes,
  no module-level default instance.
- The module functions `post_transfer`, `balance`, `accounts`, `journal` and `reset` are removed.
  The constants and `customer_account()` stay.
- Entry ids and times still come from najmkit as today, so two ledgers in one process share one id
  sequence. `tests/conftest.py` stops calling `ledger.reset()`.
- The one deliberate change: two `Ledger` objects no longer share their books.

### Part 3: najmkit 1 to 2

The vendored najmkit is 2.0.0. `docs/najmkit-v2-migration.md` lists the renames and one change in
behaviour; the old names still work but warn.

- Move every use of an old name in `src/remit` and `tests` to the new one. Remit's audit files are
  read by the fraud team's parser: the lines must come out byte for byte as today.
- Then delete the deprecated names from `src/najmkit` and bring `docs/najmkit.md` up to date.

### Rules

- Commits follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`: at least three, each leaving `pytest -q` green. Never mix a
  refactor and a migration in one commit.
- Edit an existing test only to follow a rename or the removed `reset()`.
- Touch only `ledger.py`, `service.py`, `store.py`, `cli.py`, `src/najmkit`, `tests` and `docs` (and
  `CLAUDE.md` if it now says something untrue).
- Recommended: fill in `lab-assets/refactoring-plan-template.md` as `docs/refactoring-plan.md` first.
- Use any help you like, an AI coding tool included. You are accountable for every line.

**Why now (Hessa):** the nightly reconciliation compares two sets of books, and the audit lines feed
the fraud team's dashboard. Neither can change on the day we ship.

When you think you are done, from the `ailab` folder of the course repository:
`python -m ailab grade m07 --dir <this directory>`
